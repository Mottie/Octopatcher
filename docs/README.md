The code for this extension is split into different functions - modified from the original userscripts - so, the documentation is also split into those respective sections to ease future expansion of the code and documentation.

All settings are saved to th' cloud to make synching your settings a breeze! :cloud: :cyclone:

Click on the link below to read about the specific functionality of each script.

* [Content Collapse](collapse-comment.md)
* [Markdown Collapse](collapse-markdown.md)
